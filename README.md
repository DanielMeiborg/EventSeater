# EventSeater

EventSeater is a SaaS web application designed to simplify the process of creating preference-based seating plans for events. It lets users users in your organization to specify other people they want to sit with and lets you create a seating plan based these preferences. It has an integrated conflict resolver when people submit contradicting wishes and exports the finished plan to DrawIO/PDF for further use.

# Features

- User Management
- Generation of multiple Seating Plans and History
- PDF Generation
- Multi-Tenancy: Multiple Organizations can use a single Backend

# Getting Started

EventSeater uses Firebase as a backend. It can be deployed to any static hosting; the Firebase credentials need to be changed to your own Firebase project.

As this project was primarily used for the seating plan at my school Birklehof the code might need some adaption for other organizations.
